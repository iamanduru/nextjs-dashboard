If your project requires environment variables (e.g., for API keys), add them to a .env.local file in the root directory:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-api-key

    Note: Ensure .env.local is included in your .gitignore file to avoid exposing sensitive information.
